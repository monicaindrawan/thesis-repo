## Gradient-Based Optimization Methods: Application on Structural and Heat Exchanger Application
This repository is created for my undergraduate final project on gradient based optimization of structural and heat topology. Currently, this repository only includes the FMINCON optimization method with other benchmark optimization methods to be added later. The codes are written in MATLAB and performs topology optimization on structural and heat exchanger problems. Additionally, we solve both problems in 2D and 3D domains. For more details, one can consult the project report included in this repository.
